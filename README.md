# Google Static Map Generator

A simple tool that helps with generating Google Static Maps.  It uses a slippy map so that the user can position the map how they want it and then generates the corresponding static map URL.

Information on the bounding box of the static map is also provided, this is often useful but is not possible to get just by using the static maps API.
